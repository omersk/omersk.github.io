## Introduction
Passover has come earlier than I expected, and it means that I have two options:
    * Find friends and go hanging up with them on the holidays like a normal human being.
    * Unobxing devices for fun & try to find vulnerabillities inside them.
I think that if you have read at least one blogpost that I've posted, you might already know what I chose :)

So in order to start my journey, I had to first find a victim. And as a great fan of ChatGPT I did it by ask him for recommendations:

Me:
> I want to research an embedded device for fun purposes and try to exploit it for educational reasons. However, it costs a lot of money, so I want something that will be cheap, yet interesting enough. What can I do?

ChatGPT:
>ðŸ”¥ Popular Old Routers for Hacking and Research
>        1. TP-Link TL-WR841N

Ok, so I found a victim, now let's start with the real shit.

## Research
### Pre-Purchase Research
#### Finding The Firmawre
First of all, I decided to find the firmware and see what it contains. Again, just by asking ChatGPT I've found this great website of TP-Link:
[TL-WR840N Firmwares](https://www.tp-link.com/ae/support/download/tl-wr840n/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#Firmware)
And I download the first version that I've seen: 
> TL-WR840N(EU)_V6.20_241230

#### Extracting The Firmware
Now I need to extract the firmware of the device, and it actually quite simple. By running binwalk on it, I actually solved it easily:
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp $ binwalk -e TL_WR840N.bin

```

Cool, let's see the content of the files inside it:
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp $ cd _TL_WR840N.bin.extracted
t_omersas@PC /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ ls
100200.squashfs  10400  10400.7z  squashfs-root  squashfs-root-0
```

running binwalk on 10400 lead to:
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ binwalk 10400

```
Cool, it seems like the kernel that the device is running.

Let's also examine the squashfs-root directory (which seems to be equal to squashfs-root-0 directory, and extracting 100200.squashfs file seems to be the same):
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ ls squashfs-root/*
squashfs-root/linuxrc

squashfs-root/bin:
ash  busybox  cat  chmod  cp  date  df  echo  kill  login  ls  mkdir  mount  netstat  pidof  ping  ping6  ps  rm  sh  sleep  umount

```

Amazing! it seems like a linux filesystem + some user mode programs like busybox and webserver related files.

#### Emulating The Kernel -> Failed
In this point I decided to try and emulate the linux kernel. The reasons I decided to do this are:
    * At this point I still have no setup.
    * I've never used qemu before nor any other emulation program; So why not trying?
Actually in a retrospective, it is not something I would repeat in the future, since emulating the kernel is not so efficient, and instead I think it is more rational to find bugs in a user-mode applications written by TPLink.

So in order to emulate it I had to discover first, what is the architecture of this kernel. Binwalk seems to be with very clear results:
```bash
t_omersas@PC ~ $ cd ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ vim ~/.tmux.conf
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ binwalk -A 10400

```

Ok let's go one step ahead, and try to run it using qemu:
```bash
qemu-mips 10400
Error while loading /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/10400: Exec format error
```

Asking ChatGPT leads to the reason that the file is not elf, which needed by qemu.
I tried to generate an ELF using advices from ChatGPT:
```
mipsel-linux-gnu-objcopy -I binary -O elf32-tradlittlemips -B mips 10400 10400.elf
```
then, creating a link.ld file:
```ld
SECTIONS
{
  . = 0x80000000;
  .text : { *(.text) }
  .data : { *(.data) }
  .bss  : { *(.bss)  }
}
```
and then running:
```bash
mipsel-linux-gnu-ld -T link.ld -o 10400_exec.elf 10400.elf
```
but then I got:
```
qemu-system-mipsel: Trap-and-Emul kernels (Linux CONFIG_KVM_GUEST) are not supported
```
which is very sad. Looking at the official website of qemu, I discovered that support of `Trap-and-Emul` kernels (which I have no idea what does it means) is being depreacted since qemu 6.0 or something like that:

> MIPS Trap-and-Emul KVM support (since 6.0):
> The MIPS Trap-and-Emul KVM host and guest support has been removed from Linux upstream kernel, declare it deprecated.

so I've downloaded qemu-5.0.0 by:
```bash
wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-5.0.0.tar.xz
tar -xvf qemu-5.0.0.tar.xz
cd qemu-5.0.0
```
and executed something like that:
```bash
qemu-system-mipsel -M malta -kernel 10400_exec.elf -initrd initrd.img -drive file=rootfs.sqfs,format=raw,if=mtd -append "root=/dev/mtdblock0 bash=ttyS0" -nographic
```
but now I've got something like:
```
rom: requested regions overlap (rom prom. free=0x00000000002d92ec, addr=0x0000000000002000)
qemu-system-mipsel: rom check and register reset failed
```

anyway, at this point I thought about it again, and I've got to the point that emulating the kernel is not something that I want to focus, and instead, let's focus on the filesystem, and more specific, let's focus on the web-server

#### Understanding Where The WebServer Implementation Located
So, in order to find my vulnerabillites, I looked at the file system more deeply, and tried to find some code that runs the webserver himself. Since, usually, the webservers are being executed as a user programs in the init of the system, and the webservers are usually have a different implementation to each device, I thought that it has higher precentages to include vulnerabilites.

>The webservers implementations of router almost always a user-mode program stored as a regular file in the filesystem, not part of the Linux kernel. The kernel does not load the web server itself. Instead, a user-space init system or startup script is responsible for launching it after the kernel has booted and mounted the root filesystem.
