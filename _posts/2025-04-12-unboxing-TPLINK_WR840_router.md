## Introduction
Passover has come earlier than I expected, and it means that I have two options:
    * Find friends and go hanging up with them on the holidays like a normal human being.
    * Unobxing devices for fun & try to find vulnerabillities inside them.
I think that if you have read at least one blogpost that I've posted, you might already know what I chose :)

So in order to start my journey, I had to first find a victim. And as a great fan of ChatGPT I did it by ask him for recommendations:

Me:
> I want to research an embedded device for fun purposes and try to exploit it for educational reasons. However, it costs a lot of money, so I want something that will be cheap, yet interesting enough. What can I do?

ChatGPT:
>ðŸ”¥ Popular Old Routers for Hacking and Research
>        1. TP-Link TL-WR841N

Ok, so I found a victim, now let's start with the real shit.

## Research
### Pre-Purchase Research
#### Finding The Firmawre
First of all, I decided to find the firmware and see what it contains. Again, just by asking ChatGPT I've found this great website of TP-Link:
[TL-WR840N Firmwares](https://www.tp-link.com/ae/support/download/tl-wr840n/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#Firmware)
And I download the first version that I've seen: 
> TL-WR840N(EU)_V6.20_241230

#### Extracting The Firmware
Now I need to extract the firmware of the device, and it actually quite simple. By running binwalk on it, I actually solved it easily:
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp $ binwalk -e TL_WR840N.bin

```

Cool, let's see the content of the files inside it:
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp $ cd _TL_WR840N.bin.extracted
t_omersas@PC /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ ls
100200.squashfs  10400  10400.7z  squashfs-root  squashfs-root-0
```

running binwalk on 10400 lead to:
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ binwalk 10400

```
Cool, it seems like the kernel that the device is running.

Let's also examine the squashfs-root directory (which seems to be equal to squashfs-root-0 directory, and extracting 100200.squashfs file seems to be the same):
```bash
t_omersas@PC /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ ls squashfs-root/*

squashfs-root/bin:

```

Amazing! it seems like a linux filesystem + some user mode programs like busybox and webserver related files.

#### Emulating The Kernel -> Failed
In this point I decided to try and emulate the linux kernel. The reasons I decided to do this are:
    * At this point I still have no setup.
    * I've never used qemu before nor any other emulation program; So why not trying?
Actually in a retrospective, it is not something I would repeat in the future, since emulating the kernel is not so efficient, and instead I think it is more rational to find bugs in a user-mode applications written by TPLink.

So in order to emulate it I had to discover first, what is the architecture of this kernel. Binwalk seems to be with very clear results:
```bash
t_omersas@PC ~ $ cd ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ vim ~/.tmux.conf
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted $ binwalk -A 10400

...........................
...........................
...........................
```

Ok let's go one step ahead, and try to run it using qemu:
```bash
qemu-mips 10400
Error while loading /tmp/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/10400: Exec format error
```

Asking ChatGPT leads to the reason that the file is not elf, which needed by qemu.
I tried to generate an ELF using advices from ChatGPT:
```
mipsel-linux-gnu-objcopy -I binary -O elf32-tradlittlemips -B mips 10400 10400.elf
```
then, creating a link.ld file:
```ld
SECTIONS
{
  . = 0x80000000;
  .text : { *(.text) }
  .data : { *(.data) }
  .bss  : { *(.bss)  }
}
```
and then running:
```bash
mipsel-linux-gnu-ld -T link.ld -o 10400_exec.elf 10400.elf
```
but then I got:
```
qemu-system-mipsel: Trap-and-Emul kernels (Linux CONFIG_KVM_GUEST) are not supported
```
which is very sad. Looking at the official website of qemu, I discovered that support of `Trap-and-Emul` kernels (which I have no idea what does it means) is being depreacted since qemu 6.0 or something like that:

> MIPS Trap-and-Emul KVM support (since 6.0):
> The MIPS Trap-and-Emul KVM host and guest support has been removed from Linux upstream kernel, declare it deprecated.

so I've downloaded qemu-5.0.0 by:
```bash
wget https://download.qemu.org/qemu-5.0.0.tar.xz
tar -xvf qemu-5.0.0.tar.xz
cd qemu-5.0.0
```
and executed something like that:
```bash
qemu-system-mipsel -M malta -kernel 10400_exec.elf -initrd initrd.img -drive file=rootfs.sqfs,format=raw,if=mtd -append "root=/dev/mtdblock0 bash=ttyS0" -nographic
```
but now I've got something like:
```
rom: requested regions overlap (rom prom. free=0x00000000002d92ec, addr=0x0000000000002000)
qemu-system-mipsel: rom check and register reset failed
```

anyway, at this point I thought about it again, and I've got to the point that emulating the kernel is not something that I want to focus, and instead, let's focus on the filesystem, and more specific, let's focus on the web-server

#### Understanding Where The WebServer Implementation Located
So, in order to find my vulnerabillites, I looked at the file system more deeply, and tried to find some code that runs the webserver himself. Since, usually, the webservers are being executed as a user programs in the init of the system, and the webservers are usually have a different implementation to each device, I thought that it has higher precentages to include vulnerabilites.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** The webservers implementations of router almost always a user-mode program stored as a regular file in the filesystem, not part of the Linux kernel. The kernel does not load the web server itself. Instead, a user-space init system or startup script is responsible for launching it after the kernel has booted and mounted the root filesystem.

cool, so based on this, I searched for a relevant file on the bin directory, to see, maybe there is an implementation there.

```bash

lrwxrwxrwx  1 t_omersas t_omersas       7 Apr 12 09:49 umount -> busybox
```

It seems like there is only one file that is interesting here, and this is the busybox. 
> **ðŸ’¡ Tip:** BusyBox provides a minimal implementation of init and the whole suite of core Unix tools.

The busybox file seems to be an MIPSEL elf, and by opening it on IDA and searching for relevant strings, I didn't find any relevant data for an http server :(
for example, I didn't find a string that includes "index.htm" which I saw in the web directory and appears to be the html file of the main page of the router webserver...

Anyway, I decided to try and emulate this file, and maybe I will discover some other relevant data about him:

```bash
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/squashfs-root $ sudo qemu-mipsel -L . ./bin/busybox
./bin/busybox: cache '/etc/ld.so.cache' is corrupt
BusyBox v1.19.2 (2024-12-30 15:52:05 CST) multi-call binary.
Copyright (C) 1998-2011 Erik Andersen, Rob Landley, Denys Vlasenko
and others. Licensed under GPLv2.
See source distribution for full notice.

Usage: busybox [function] [arguments]...
   or: busybox --list[-full]
   or: function [arguments]...

        BusyBox is a multi-call binary that combines many common Unix
        utilities into a single executable.  Most people will create a
        link to busybox for each function they wish to use and BusyBox
        will act like whatever it was invoked as.

Currently defined functions:
        arping, ash, brctl, cat, chmod, cp, date, df, echo, free, getty, halt,
        ifconfig, init, insmod, ipcrm, ipcs, kill, killall, linuxrc, login, ls,
        lsmod, mkdir, mount, netstat, pidof, ping, ping6, poweroff, ps, reboot,
        rm, rmmod, route, sh, sleep, taskset, tftp, top, umount, vconfig
```

looks good! seems like an implementation for a several functions... let's try to arping to 8.8.8.8:
```bash
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/squashfs-root $ sudo qemu-mipsel -L . ./bin/busybox arping 8.8.8.8
./bin/busybox: cache '/etc/ld.so.cache' is corrupt
ARPING to 8.8.8.8 from 172.20.123.158 via eth0
^CSent 25 probe(s) (25 broadcast(s))
Received 0 reply (0 request(s), 0 broadcast(s))
```
seems to fail, but it starts well.... maybe it's because of the emulation.

Anyway, let's keep searching for our webserver. By looking at some more directories I saw another suspicious file: /etc/init.d/rcS

```bash
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/squashfs-root $ cat etc/init.d/rcS

Looking deeply in the file, didn't lead to any lines that looks like running a webserver or something like that. 
Keep on searching....

Looking on the directory bin looks the most promoising result up now:
```bash
t_omersas@PC ~/projects/_TL_WR840N.bin.extracted/squashfs-root $ ls usr/bin
afcd     cmxdns  dhcpd     dropbearkey    ebtables  igmpd      ipcrm   iptables  killall  pwdog      taskset  tdpd  top         wanType        xtables-multi

```


Cool! there is the implementation for the webserver `httpd` and in addition, it seems like there is also an implementation for a tftp.

Running strings on the http file shows that it really our desired file, as it holds all the files that we saw in the /web/main dir.
